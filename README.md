# Semantic-search-engine
Creating a semantic search engine by making use of genism-topic modelling and flask framework

This is a simple web application built using flask framework in Python that performs semantic searching of a pre-prepared MongoDB database containing information about tourist destinations in Kerala(one of the states in India). So for a given user query such as "I wish to have some adventures in Kerala, this web application will display top search results relating to Adventure Tourism in Kerala in a Google like manner with title,url for redirection to respective webpages and short description for each result. Even for beginners,this entire application can be built from scratch in a matter of four or five hours. Although this project in its current form is a web app that caters to "Kerala Tourism", making a tiny change(specifically in the Python List containing website URL's used for scrapping) can make this search engine work for any other text-data related task that you have in mind.
